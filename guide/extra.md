## The emails from Prayer Partners are flooding my inbox. Can I remove them from my main inbox?

Yes, you can create a filter in your Gmail using Settings > Filters and Blocked Addresses > Create a new filter. Add PrayerPartners (note: no space in between) in the subject for the filter. Then select the options to skip the inbox and apply a label.

## How do I update my data with the latest emails I received?
